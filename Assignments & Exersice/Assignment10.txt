1) Write a query that produces all pairs of salespeople who are living in the same
city. Exclude combinations of salespeople with themselves as well as duplicate

	from salespeople as s1,salespeople as SA1 

	where s1.city = SA1.city and 
	s1.Sname != SA1.Sname 
	
group by city; 



2) Write a query that produces the names and cities of all customers with the same
rating as Hoffman.

> select Cname,City from customers 
	
	where rating = (select rating from customers where Cname = 'Hoffman') and
 
    	Cname != 'Hoffman' ;

> select Cname,City from customers 
	
	where rating = (select rating from customers where Cname = 'Hoffman') ;
