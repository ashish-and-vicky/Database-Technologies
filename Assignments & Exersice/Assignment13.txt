Using the UNION clause.

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

> select Cname, city, "Having Rating" rating from customers where rating >= 200

				union

  select Cname, city, "Low Rating" rating from customers where rating <= 200 ;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
order.

> select * from (select Cname as Name,Cnum as Num 
		from customers 
		where Cnum IN (select Cnum  
				from orders 
				group by Cnum having count(Cnum) > 1 )
	
		union

  select Sname,Snum from salespeople 
			where Snum IN (select Snum 
					from orders 
					group by Snum 
					having count(Snum) > 1)) as l1 
					order by l1.name;


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
besides the point.)

> select Snum as num from salespeople where city = "San Jose"
	
		union

  select y.Cnum from (select Cnum from customers where city = "San Jose" 
	
		union all

  select Onum from orders where Odate like  "%-10-03")as y;
