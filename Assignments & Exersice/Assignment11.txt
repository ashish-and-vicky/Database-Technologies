Subqueries.


1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named
Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).

> select Onum, Amt from orders 
	where Cnum in (select Cnum from customers where Cname = 'Cisneros') ;

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.

> select Cname, rating from customers 
	
where Cnum in (select Cnum from orders where amt > (select avg(amt) from orders));





3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

> 
select Snum,sum(Amt) 
	
from orders 

	group by Snum 
	
having  sum(amt) > (select max(amt) from orders);
